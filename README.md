# Queue app - description

JAVA was used to create this project, using NETBEANS. A GUI was developed, including the required components.

Advantages of this GUI:
- Ease of use.
- Radio buttons & textfields are cleared/reset for repetetive use.
- It can be run, closed, then opened again - details of new customers will still be saved underneath the previous ones.

Disadvantages:

- Every time a radio button is clicked, it will still be printed onto the seperate file of data until 'Submit' is clicked; so it would have to be used once and accurately.
- The customers are not numbered, but placed in order from top-bottom.
- The GUI is not linked to a browser, as a frame (JFrame) cannot be added to an applet in JAVA.
- Anonymous customers would have to click on the corresponding service and on 'Anonymous', without typing their name nor last name because by default the program automatically outputs the name and last name on the file note. They would just select between Mr, Ms, Mrs & Miss. The time will also be displayed.
- Organisations would have to type their organisation name in the 'First Name' field. There would also be a title displayed.
